# Why was this stack chosen?

Node is a pretty lightweight server choice and can be spun up fairly easily. We needed a backend that could send a different response based on the result of another controller and the ability to dynamically render file. By using Express' built in middleware architecture we could cleanly write fallbacks. Mongodb  we needed a very simple yet powerful database to handle all of our user data. Ejs template engine a very simple and yet powerful template for the front -end (view).
