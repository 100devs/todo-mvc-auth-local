The back-end was build using Node.js and the Express framework to handle all routes and controller logic. We used EJS as our templating engine for the View, MongoDB & Mongoose for our database and Model logic, Passport.js to handle authentication, bcrypt to salt and hash user passwords, and Bootstrap to style the front-end.
