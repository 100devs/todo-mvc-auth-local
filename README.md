# Group Additions
We are planning to add...

1. Time estimated to complete task
  ~~- alter the schema/object stored in our collections~~
  - alter the todos.ejs to add input field for estimated time to complete task

2.  Start button to 'start' task, should log current time
  ~~- alter the schema/object stored in our collections~~
  - alter the todos.ejs to add a button
  - add a smurf which also listens for that button and adds the current to db

3.  Alter the way we mark something complete
  - alter the schema to track the time todo was marked as complete
  - alter the smurf for marking complete to also get the current time
  * optionally display the time marked complete to the user, which would mean altering the ejs

4. Compute the delta between estimated completion time vs. actual completion time
  - alter the ejs to show this
  - alter the css if we want to change the display for the user
