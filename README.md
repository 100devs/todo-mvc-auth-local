## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, using the MVC Architecture

This is a simple ToDo App remade into a lovely Christmas shopping list. Built using the MVC Architecture with authorization so folx can sign up to track what they have to buy before Christmas! We created the Christmas theme through ejs and CSS, embed Christmas music into the page, and implemented a Christmas countdown timer. 

## Optimizations

Some features to add can include adding more features to list organization (i.e. a list for multiple gifts to the same person) and shareable private lists for users without an account to see.
