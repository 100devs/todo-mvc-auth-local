---

# Packages/Dependencies used

### Wait, did you run `npm audit fix` or `npm audit fix--force` ?
- Go to config > `database.js`
- remove `mongoose.connect()` options: 
  - `useFindAndModify: false,`
  - `useCreateIndex: true`

### Why?
`useFindAndModify` and `useCreateIndex` are no longer supported in the latest version of Mongoose. Running `npm audit fix` updates Mongoose to the latest version, and will no longer support these `mongoose.connect()` options. Alternatively, you can also downgrading Mongoose back to v5.
