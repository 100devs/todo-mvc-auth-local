What do we want the app to do?
Ideas: Shopping list, anything list format, Christmas shopping list

Themed list, writing a letter to santa, 

Changes: changing done to purchased, and adding a "for: person" section. If "for:" is added, should we add a sort function a-z name?

Fork -> Clone to 1 machine. Fork from that machine, pull requests that machine.
